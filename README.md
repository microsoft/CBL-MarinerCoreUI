# CBL-MarinerCoreUI

CBL-MarinerCoreUI is an internal extension of the internal [CBL-Mariner](https://github.com/microsoft/CBL-Mariner) Linux distribution for Microsoft’s cloud infrastructure and edge products and services. CBL-Mariner is designed to provide a consistent platform for these devices and services and will enhance Microsoft’s ability to stay current on Linux updates. This initiative is part of Microsoft’s increasing investment in a wide range of Linux technologies.  CBL-MarinerCoreUI is being shared publicly as part of Microsoft’s commitment to Open Source and to contribute back to the Linux community. 

As with CBL-Mariner, CBL-MarinerCoreUI makes the latest security patches and fixes available for download with the goal of fast turn-around times.

CBL-MarinerCoreUI uses the same build system as CBL-Mariner.
