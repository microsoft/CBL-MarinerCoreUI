# Best effort validation of the package cgmanifest. It will check, for each spec file passed, that:
#
#   - The registration for the package name/version is in the cgmanifest
#   - The source0 basename (not full url) is a substring of the cgmanifest url
#     - OR that a #source0 comment is a substring of the cgmanifest url
#   - The URL listed in the cgmanifets is valid (can be downloaded)

# $@ - Paths to spec files to check

# Ignore some specs, mostly those with Source0 files that are not from an external source, or have very odd URLs
